Make sure you have python and pygame installed. If you don't have pygame installed but you have python installed you can
simply run:
pip install pygame
in a terminal with administrative permissions. cmd should already have admin permissions.

Once you have the prerequisites you can run:
python main.py
with a terminal in the folder where this file is.

You can press esc to close the application, same as the X button. Feel free
to play around with the settings. When you restart the app they will go back to their defaults. "Run strength will make
the boids fly towards (to the left of the centre), or fly away (to the right of the centre) from your mouse.

You can also go into the code itself and change things there. The main place I would suggest is changing code inside
main.py to play around with things. If you change code from the other files you might break some stuff.

(Something fun, go to line 46 in main.py and change drawMode to True, save the file, and then run the above command again 
to have some realing cool visuals happen. If you want it back to normal, just change it back to False and save.)
